                        I'm Sloan, and am currently inrolled in a coding bootcamp.
                        My favorite food is Katsu-curry, and I am obsessed with 
                        Japanese architecture.

                    <p>
                        So much so that I learned the language
                        and lived there for a year. At the moment, I am an aspiring full-stack 
                        developer, just getting my feet wet in new technologies. I am sure that 
                        this site will look much better as the bootcamp goes on.

                        Feel free to take a look around the page.
                        As my bootcamp goes on and I learn more and more skills, 
                        I will soon be adding a section called 'projects.'
                        Until then, feel free to ponder over my github profile that is 
                        provided in the contact section of this page.

                    One of my many hobbies is learning new things, 
                    but that is quite vague. So below I've made a list of 
                    things I enjoy doing in no specific order:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✈️Traveling</li>
                        <li>🌐Learning new languages</li>
                        <li>👨‍💻Graphics programming (and programming in general)</li>
                        <li>📚Reading</li>
                        <li>👽Ufology</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Yes, I did say Ufology... I want to believe!
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="skill-card card" id="skill">
            <h1 class="card-title">What I Can Do</h1>
            <div class="card-content">
                <p>
                    I have been programming since I was 16 years old and 
                    have used many different languages including Javascript, Golang, Python,
                    C# and Java. 
                </p>

                <h2>Projects I've worked on:</h2>
                <h3>Weeb Keeper</h3>
                <p>
                    Weeb Keeper is a web app designed for anime fans. It allows users to keep track
                    of the current anime they are wanting to watch, currently watching, and have completed.
                    It also allows the user to discover trending anime on the discover page, as well as to search
                    for anime they would like to add to their watch list.

                <h3>Critique Code</h3>
                <p>
                    Critique Code takes the good parts of Reddit and Stackoverflow and mashes them together. 
                    Tired of getting personally attacked for asking a question on Stackoverflow? Critique Code solves that.
                    Critique Code is meant to be a place where new or veteran developers can come and discuss the thing that they
                    share in common: An interest in code. Critique Code doesn't take it's self too seriously, and we expect the users
                    to also share the same ideal. Make jokes, show intentionally bad code. Just have a good time!

                <h3>Slay the Market</h3>
                <p>
                    Slay the Market takes your traditional deck builder game and adds a twist. 
                    Fight off NFT bros, slay crypto bosses and and choose your cards wisely.
